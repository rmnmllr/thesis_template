# Multi-file Thesis Template for LaTeX

This template can be used for a larger thesis written in LaTeX.

## Requirements
Please install LateX through [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) for your operating system.
Compilation has been tested with TeX Live 2023 on a unix machine.

## Citation Format
The template has the [APA citation style](https://apastyle.apa.org/) implemented with a slight tweak for personal preference.
As with everything LaTeX the style is quite flexible.
